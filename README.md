## Problem:
#### Why customers churn?
#### How can you improve customer retention?


## Project Summary:
The Customer Churn table contains information on all 7,043 customers 
from a Telecommunications company in California in Q2 2022
Each record represents one customer, and contains details about their demographics, location, tenure, 
subscription services, status for the quarter (joined, stayed, or churned), and more!



## Steps :

#### I analyzed the data via SQL and understood it well, then I started the analysis process and found the main problem is that the customers churn because of the presence of competitors' internet devices that are better than ours
#### After that, I extracted important insight from the data and made a set of relationships between the data and some of them
#### In the last step, I made graphs using power bi to illustrate the final numbers into illustrations in order to show what we have to do and take decisions that benefit the company

## recommendation

#### Communicate Effectively: Keeping customers informed of changes in the product or service
#### Improving the company's equipment to suit customer requirements, because this is the most reason for customers to leave
#### Improve customer service : Responding to customer inquiries and complaints quickly and effectively can help build customer loyalty
#### Use customer data to deliver customized offers and promotions : By offering discounts, bonuses and incentives
